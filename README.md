Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
In this project instead of analysing and predicting the stock performance of an index(e.g. NIFTY or SENSEX) i tried analysing the stock price of one of the listed companies of NSE i.e. ONGC. I extracted the news data by scraping 'www.moneycontrol.com' using scrapy. The numerical data is obtained from a python library named nsepy.
